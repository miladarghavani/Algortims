# Problem: [Stone Removal Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-removal-game/description/) (LeetCode Problem #3360)

## Problem Description
There is a pile of stones, and each stone is either removed or kept. In the Stone Removal Game, players take turns removing stones in the following way:

- A player removes 1 or 2 stones at a time.
- The number of stones removed each turn must be either 1 or 2.
- A player who removes the last stone wins.

You are given an integer `stones` which represents the number of stones in the pile. Return `true` if the first player will win, and `false` if the first player will lose. It is assumed that both players play optimally.

### Constraints:
- The number of stones is a positive integer in the range `[1, 1000]`.

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`stones = 5`

**Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
The first player can take 1 stone, leaving 4 stones, and no matter what the second player does, the first player can always win by taking 2 stones next.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`stones = 6`

**Output:**  
`false`

**Explanation:**  
The first player can take either 1 or 2 stones, but the second player can always leave 1 stone for the first player, making the second player win.

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`stones = 3`

**Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
The first player can take 1 stone, leaving 2 stones, and then the second player will be forced to take the remaining 1 stone, resulting in the first player winning.

## LeetCode Description
This problem is about determining if the first player can win in a stone removal game where two players take turns removing stones optimally.

### Hint:
- Consider the last few moves and how they influence the outcome of the game.
- The problem can be reduced to a decision based on whether the number of stones is odd or even.
