193.Phone Number Validator

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-phone-numbers/description/

Given a text file file.txt that contains a list of phone numbers (one per line), write a function to validate and print all valid phone numbers.

A valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats:
- (xxx) xxx-xxxx
- xxx-xxx-xxxx

(x means a digit)

Assume each line in the text file does not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

Example:
Assume that file.txt has the following content:

987-123-4567
123 456 7890
(123) 456-7890

Your function should output the following valid phone numbers:
987-123-4567
(123) 456-7890

Constraints:
- The input consists of a list of phone numbers, one per line.
- The phone numbers may have different formats, and only valid formats should be returned.
